# kidsGame2d

A lightweight Unity 2D project (C#) aimed at building fun, beginner-friendly gameplay for kids. Built with standard Unity project structure for easy onboarding and cross‑platform builds.
---

## Highlights

- **Unity 2D + C#**: Familiar, approachable stack for fast iteration and learning.
- **Clean structure**: Standard Unity layout (`Assets/`, `Packages/`, `ProjectSettings/`) for easy navigation and portability.
- **Editor-friendly**: Open and run directly in Unity; no custom bootstrap required.
- **Cross‑platform ready**: Build to Windows, macOS, WebGL, Android, or iOS via Unity Build Settings.
- **IDE support**: Visual Studio solution files (`.sln`, `.csproj`) included for debugging and code navigation.

---

## Project Structure

- `Assets/` — Source code, scenes, prefabs, sprites, audio, and other game assets.
- `Packages/` — Unity package manifest and lock; controls package versions.
- `ProjectSettings/` — Unity project/editor settings (input, quality, graphics, etc.).
- `Library/` — Auto-generated by Unity (safe to delete; Unity will recreate).
- `kidsGame2d.sln`, `Assembly-CSharp.csproj` — IDE integration files for C# editing/debugging.

> Note: `Library/` is typically not stored in Git because it’s generated; if you encounter import issues, delete it and reopen the project to let Unity regenerate.

---

## Requirements

- Unity Hub + Unity Editor (use the version suggested by Unity Hub when opening; if unknown, try the latest 2021/2022/2023 LTS).
- Optional: Visual Studio or Rider for C# editing and debugging.

---

## Getting Started (Run in Editor)

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdo-hany48/kidsGame2d.git
   ```
2. Open Unity Hub → Add project → select the cloned folder.
3. If Unity prompts for a specific version, install/open with that version.
4. Wait for packages to resolve and assets to import.
5. In the Project window, open the main scene (commonly under `Assets/Scenes/`).
6. Press Play in the Unity Editor toolbar.

If you see import or script errors:
- Close Unity, delete the `Library/` folder, reopen via Unity Hub.
- In Unity: Window → Package Manager → resolve any missing packages.
- Assets → Reimport All.

---

## Building

1. File → Build Settings…
2. Add Open Scenes (ensure your main scene is included).
3. Select target platform (e.g., PC, Mac & Linux Standalone, WebGL, Android).
4. Player Settings… (set product name, resolution, icon as needed).
5. Click Build (or Build and Run), choose an output directory.

Platform notes:
- WebGL: ensure `Compression Format` and hosting supports it.
- Android/iOS: install respective build support components via Unity Hub.

## Controls

Typical 2D controls (varies per scene):
- Keyboard: Arrow keys / WASD
- Mouse/Touch: UI interaction and simple gameplay taps/clicks

Check in‑game instructions or the Input settings (`ProjectSettings/`) for exact mappings.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Stuck on import/compile: delete `Library/`, reopen the project.
- Package errors: open Package Manager and click “Resolve”/“Restore”.
- Missing scenes: verify the correct scene is added to Build Settings.
- API compatibility: Project Settings → Player → API Compatibility Level = `.NET 4.x` (if scripts require it).

---

## Roadmap Ideas

- Add a unified `Assets/Scenes/Main.unity` entry point.
- In‑editor instruction panels to guide first‑time players.
- Basic Settings menu (audio volume, difficulty).
- CI for automated builds (e.g., WebGL preview).
